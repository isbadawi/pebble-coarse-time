Coarse Time
-----------

This is a Pebble watchface that displays the time with very coarse granularity.
It will say "Night" between 9pm and 5am, "Morning" between 5am and 12pm,
"Afternoon" between 12pm and 5pm, and "Evening" between 5pm and 9pm.

It can also be configured to display these in French, although I couldn't
figure out how to draw accented characters so it'll say "Apres-midi"
instead of the more correct "Apr√®s-midi".
